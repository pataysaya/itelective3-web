# Attendance Monitoring System
The attendance system is used to monitor the __attendance__ and __movement__ of employees within their working hours and to prepare materials for processing wages.

Using the attendance system will allow you to diminish the number of errors occurring when processing attendance data, better use the working hours by raising the quality of employees’ personal approach to work duties **(increase in work morale)**, and prevent overtime being claimed unjustifiably.


Access modules will help you to restrict people from entering individual company buildings, car parks or to enable the access of authorized personnel to the manufacturing unit, etc.

Components of the attendance and access system
Attendance and access terminals, locks, gates, barriers, doors, turnstiles, identification media – contactless card or pendant, key chain with integral chip, fingerprint software for processing attendance and access setting
